# Feats & Doctrines

**Doctrines** are long-term perks that enhance your retinues and faction troops as you play. They are organized in a grid with rows, columns, and prerequisites. As you complete feats, you unlock new doctrines.

> Open them from **Clan → Troops → Doctrines**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Earn feats**  
   Playing the game (winning battles, capturing fiefs, crafting, etc.) progresses various **feats**. Each doctrine has its own feat track.

2. **Unlock doctrines**  
   When you have enough feat progress (and if **Feat Requirements** are enabled), the doctrine becomes available. Unlocking a doctrine is permanent for that save.

3. **Stack the effects**  
   All unlocked doctrines are always active at the same time. You are not choosing one column or one row: everything you unlock stacks.

The doctrine grid is organized in **five columns**, each with its own theme:

- **Spoils** – how quickly you discover and unlock new gear.
- **Armory** – rebates, culture-themed gear, crafted weapons, and tier limits.
- **Rister** – militias, caravans, villagers, and captains / officer systems.
- **Training** – skill caps, skill points, upgrade branches, and XP handling.
- **Retinues** – retinue size, durability, morale, and survival.

Below is a quick reference of all doctrines and what they do.

## Feats

- **Combat Feats:** awarded for outcomes in *played battles* (field, siege, etc.).  
  **Important:** **simulated/autoresolved battles do not count** for combat feats.

- **Logistics & Training Feats:** tied to training actions, upgrade flows, or sustained unit development.

- **Objective Feats:** progress by completing world tasks (e.g., rescuing caravans/villagers).

- **Retinue-Focused Feats:** reward you for fielding and improving your retinues.

You will get on-screen notifications as feats progress or complete.

---

## Config Options (MCM)

- **Enable Feat Requirements** *(restart)*  
  When **ON**, doctrines **enforce feat prerequisites** (you must complete the listed feats to unlock them).  
  When **OFF**, feat requirements are ignored and doctrines can be unlocked freely.
