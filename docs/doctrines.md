# Feats & Doctrines

**Doctrines** are long-term perks that enhance your retinues and faction troops as you play. They’re organized in a **grid** with rows, columns, and **prerequisites**. As you complete **feats**, you unlock new doctrines.

> Open them from **Clan → Troops → Doctrines**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Browse the grid**  
   Each doctrine card shows its **requirements** and the **bonuses** it grants.

2. **Meet the requirements**  
   Doctrines have specific feat requirements to be unlocked (these can be relaxed; see **MCM** below).

3. **Progress feats**  
   Feats level up while you play and can unlock new doctrines.

4. **Enjoy the bonuses**  
   Bonuses are passive and apply automatically once unlocked.

## Feats

- **Combat Feats:** awarded for outcomes in **played battles** (field, siege, etc.).  
  **Important:** **simulated/autoresolved battles do not count** for combat feats.

- **Logistics & Training Feats:** tied to training actions, upgrade flows, or sustained unit development.

- **Objective Feats:** progress by completing world tasks (e.g., rescuing caravans/villagers).

- **Retinue-Focused Feats:** reward you for fielding and improving your **Basic/Elite Retinues**.

You’ll get **on-screen notifications** as feats progress or complete.

---

## Config Options (MCM)

- **Disable Feat Requirements**  
  Turn this **ON** for a simpler experience (doctrines unlock without strict prerequisites).  
  Turn **OFF** for a progression-heavy run where accomplishing feats matter.

## Cheats

- Use the **cheat console** to unlock doctrines or bump feats for testing or troubleshooting.
