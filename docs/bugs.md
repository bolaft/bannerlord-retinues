# Bug Reports

Thanks for helping improve Retinues! Please follow the steps below so we can reproduce and fix issues quickly.

Before proceeding further, make sure your issue can't be solved by following the instructions in the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) section.

---

## 1) Where to report

- **Nexus Mods Bug Tracker (preferred):**  
  👉 Open the Retinues bugs page and click **“Report a bug.”**  
  https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/8847?tab=bugs

The Nexus Mods **Bugs** tab is the only place I can guarantee I will look at your report.

---

## 2) What to include (checklist)

- **Short title** and a **clear description** of the issue.
- **When it happens**: exact steps to reproduce (which screen, which actions, party/settlement, etc.).
- **Your `debug.log` file** (paths below).
- *(Optional but very helpful)* **Your save file** at/near the issue.

> Crash? If you use **BetterExceptionWindow**, include its crash report, too.

---

## 3) Attach your `debug.log`

**Path depends on how you installed the mod:**

- **Nexus zip install:**
  ```
  <Bannerlord>\Modules\Retinues\debug.log
  ```

- **Steam Workshop:**
  ```
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\261550\3592533567\debug.log
  ```

> Steam folder IDs may differ, use the search bar if you can't find it.

If the file is large, upload it to **Pastebin** or a file host and paste the link in your bug report.

### Quick Pastebin upload
1. Go to https://pastebin.com
2. Paste the contents of `debug.log`
3. Set **Expiration** to at least **1 Week**
4. Click **Create New Paste** and copy the URL into your bug report

*(Alternatives: GitHub Gist, Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer.)*

## 4) (Optional) Attach your save file

Sharing your save can be quite helpful in finding out the root cause of a bug.

Saves are located here (copy/paste into Explorer):
```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Game Saves
```

Pick the most recent save where the problem occurs.

> If the save file is large, compress it first.

---

## 5) Privacy note

Save files contain in‑game data only. Please do **not** include personal documents or unrelated files in uploads.

## 6) Thank you!

Clear steps + logs = fast fixes. Thanks for the help! 👍
