# Experience

Troops in **Retinues** gain, spend, and (sometimes) refund **XP**.
This XP is not the same as vanilla XP which is calculated separately, and is used to improve custom troops.

---

## XP Sources

### 1) Played Battles (on mission end)
When you **fight the battle yourself**, your **custom** player-side troops gain XP **per valid kill**, scaled by the **victim's tier**. The XP is awarded **after the battle ends**. (Autoresolve rules are separate; see below.)

### 2) Simulated/Autoresolved Battles
When a battle is **simulated**, your custom troops (including those present in allied parties) receive a **smaller, proportional XP grant** based on the enemy forces and your side's troop counts **snapshotted at battle start**. This keeps autoresolve competitive without eclipsing played battles.

### 3) Daily Training
Each in-game day, your **main party's** custom troops gain **training XP** derived from the vanilla training model, at a **reduced fraction**.

> Note: Only **custom** troops managed by Retinues receive XP from these systems. Vanilla troops keep using vanilla rules.

## Spending XP

### Skill Increases
Raising a skill consumes **XP** that scales with the skill's **current value**.  
  → See: [Skills](./skills.md)

### Rank Up (Retinues)
Ranking up a **retinue** spends **gold** and also deducts from the troop's **XP pool**. Make sure both requirements are met before ranking up.  
  → See: [Retinues](./retinues.md)

## Refunding XP

- **Adaptive Training doctrine** allows **refunds** of XP when you **decrement** a skill point.  
- Without that doctrine, refunds are **not** granted.

## Per-Troop vs Shared XP Pool

In **Mod Options (MCM)** you can choose to use a **Shared XP Pool** for your custom troops, or let each troop keep an **individual** pool. A shared pool is simpler (all edits draw from the same bucket); separate pools encourage more targeted training.
