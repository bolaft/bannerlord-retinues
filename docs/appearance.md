# Appearance Customization

You can control a troop or hero's name, culture, gender, and appearance from the Retinues editor.

---

## Name & Culture

In the **Troops** tab, select a unit and open its **Editor panel** (right side).

- **Name:** edit the displayed name directly.
- **Culture:** choose any vanilla or modded culture.  
  Changing culture also updates the character's appearance to match that culture's visual presets (hair, beard, tattoos, etc., as available).
- **Race:** if Retinues runs alongside a mod that adds new playable non-human creatures, such as elves, giants, undead etc., you can also assign any modded race to the troop.

> Culture choice also interacts with certain equipment unlock rules (see your MCM options and the Equipment page).

---

## Gender

Below the 3D character preview (bottom-left corner) there is an icon toggle:

- **Default behavior:** toggles **Gender** only (Male/Female).

---

## Appearance Controls (troops)

If you enable **Appearance Controls** in the mod configuration, the bottom-left panel exposes additional dials for **non-hero troops**:

- **Age**
- **Height**
- **Weight**
- **Build**

These allow you to fine-tune a troop's body shape beyond the gender toggle.

## Hero Character Editor

When editing a hero (in the global editor), the old customization controls are replaced by a button to open the **full character editor**, identical to the one used during character creation.

For heroes you can:

- Adjust **face**, **body**, **hair**, **beard**, and **tattoos** using the full set of character-creation sliders.
- Preview changes directly in the 3D view as you tweak them.

This full character editor is only available for heroes; regular troops continue to use the simpler appearance controls.
