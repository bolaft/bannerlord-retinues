# Overview

Retinues lets you create special, limited-count units that you can fully equip and train, as well as full-fledged custom troop trees for your clan and kingdom. Unlock new gear by defeating enemies, spend earned experience to raise skills, promote retinues through tiers, and (once you own a fief) unlock and redesign your clan troop tree. Later, founding a kingdom opens kingdom troop trees and king’s guard retinues. Optional Doctrines grant passive bonuses, but require the player to accomplish special feats before they can be unlocked.

## Quick Start

All mod features live in the **Clan → Troops** tab. Open your Clan screen and select **Troops** to access everything.
