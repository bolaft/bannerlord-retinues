# Clan & Kingdom Troops

There are two kinds of faction-bound troops you can build with Retinues:
- **Clan Troops** (tied to your **clan**)
- **Kingdom Troops** (tied to your **kingdom**)

Unlike **Retinues** (your personal household guard), faction troops are the **broader troop trees** that populate your rosters, parties, garrisons, and volunteers.

---

## Unlocking

- **Clan Troops** → unlock when you **acquire your first fief**.  
- **Kingdom Troops** → unlock when you **found your own kingdom**.

> When the *Recruit Anywhere* option is enabled, clan troops are immediately unlocked even if you don't own a fief.

On unlock, you choose **how to initialize** that faction’s troop ecosystem:
- **Start from scratch:** minimal roots at low tier; build up over time.
- **Clone entire culture tree:** instantly copy the vanilla culture lines as a starting point.

> This choice is **per faction layer** (clan vs kingdom) and **not reversible** for that layer.

---

## What You Get

Each faction layer (clan or kingdom) provides:

- A **Regular Tree** (T1 → …)  
- An **Elite Tree** (noble line)  
- Unlockable **Militias** aligned with your culture

---

## Recruitment

Faction troops join your army the **vanilla way** (with helpful Retinues options):

- **Clan troops** are available in any settlement owned by your clan.
- **Kingdom troops** are available in any settlement owned by another clan of your kingdom

> It might take an in-game day or two for volunteers to refresh after unlocking a custom troop tree.

- **Recruit Anywhere (optional):** Enable in **MCM** to recruit your clan/kingdom custom troops from **any** settlement. Disable for stricter, more “realistic” availability.

> Retinues-specific **auto-hire** and **manual conversion** do **not** apply here; those are for the [Retinues](./retinues.md) only.

---

## Militas

- Unlock the **Cultural Pride** doctrine to gain access to customizable militias.
- Custom militias replace the default cultural ones in your faction's fiefs automatically (daily swap).

---

## Doctrines

**Doctrines** provide passive bonuses that can benefit your clan and kingdom troops and enable new customization options.

## Import / Export

- Custom troops can be exported and export from one save to another via the mod config menu or the cheat console.
