# 7) Appearance Customization

You can control a troop’s **name, culture, gender, and (optionally) detailed body settings** from the Retinues editor.

---

## Name & Culture (Editor Panel)

In the **Troops** tab, select a unit and open its **Editor panel** (right side).

- **Name:** edit the displayed name directly.
- **Culture:** choose **any vanilla or modded culture**.  
  Changing culture **also updates the character’s appearance** to match that culture’s visual presets (hair, beard, tattoos, etc., as available).

> Culture choice also interacts with certain equipment unlock rules (see your MCM options and the Equipment page).

---

## Gender Toggle (Character Model)

Below the 3D character **preview** (bottom-left corner) there is an **icon toggle**:

- **Default behavior:** toggles **Gender** only (Male/Female).  
  Use this when you just want to flip the base presentation quickly.

---

## Experimental: Detailed Appearance Controls

If you enable **Experimental Appearance Controls** in **MCM**, the bottom-left panel exposes additional dials:

- **Age**
- **Height**
- **Weight**
- **Build**

These allow you to fine-tune the character’s body shape beyond the gender toggle.

> **⚠️ Warning (Experimental):**  
> These controls are **experimental** and may have **unintended effects**, such as clipping with certain armors, unexpected hair/face combinations in some cultures, or visual inconsistencies after large age/height deltas. If you run into odd visuals, revert the sliders, switch cultures briefly to refresh presets, or disable the experimental option in MCM.
