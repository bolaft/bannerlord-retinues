## Script

Welcome to Retinues, a mod for Bannerlord that adds several troop customization features and mechanics to the game.

You can use the mod from an existing save, but I recommend starting a new game to get the intended experience.

After installing the mod, if you go in the clan screen you will notice a new tab, the "Troops" tab.

This is were most of the mod's features are located.

Initially, you will only have access to two retinues units, a basic one and an elite one.

They are low tier and poorly equipped, but soon enough you will be able to unlock better gear and improve their skills.

Retinues are a special kind of unit that are hired from regular troops of the same tier and culture.

They are limited in numbers and cannot be garrisoned.

Here in the equipment screen, you can see all the items that are available. At first, only a handful of basic items are unlocked.

So how do you unlock more items? Well it's simple: by doing battle.

As you defeat enemy troops, you will progressively unlock the items they were wearing.

Fight vlandians, you will get vlandian gear. Fight sturgians, you will get sturgian gear.

Of course to get the best stuff you will have to fight their best troops.

Once you have a better roster of items, you can go back to the equipment screen and outfit your retinues with better gear.

Notice that when you acquire an item, the previous one becomes stocked. So if you want to pass it on to a different troop, it will be free.

As your troops fight, they gain individual experience, but that experience also goes into a shared XP pool.

By spending from that pool you can improve your custom troops' skills.

In the special case of retinues, once they have reached their maximum amount of skill points, they can rank up and go up a tier.

Of course once they rank up, they will need to be converted from higher tier units.

Eventually your clan will acquire a fief or two, and you will now have access to the entire clan troop tree.

As you can see, at first that troop tree is based on your clan's culture.

But as you invest in their skills and equipment they will become more and more effective.

You can also rework the troop tree to add or remove upgrade paths as you see fit.

Unlike retinues those troops are recruited the normal way, but exclusively in your clan's fiefs.

AI lords can also recruit those troops from your clan's towns and villages: unlike retinues clan troops are not exclusive to the player.

If you want to improve your personal army even further, there is also the doctrines screen.

It's optional, and it presents itself as a tech tree of sorts.

Each doctrine has three feat requirements and a gold cost. Upon achieving the feats, you can unlock the doctrine by paying the gold cost.

Each doctrine provides a passive bonus to your custom troops.

Retinues have doctrines of their own, making them special troops, with special bonuses.

Finally, in the late game you might want to start your own kingdom.

When you do, you will unlock access to your kingdom's custom troop trees.

Kingdom troops are based on the kingdom culture, which can be different from your own clan's culture.

You will also be able to recruit king's guard retinues, doubling the amount of retinue troops you can have in your party.

Of course you'll have to equip and train them first, but at this point in the game you probably have the resources to do so.

Most of the mod's features are optional, and can be toggled on or off.

So if you want freeform troop customization for free with all items unlocked from the start, you can.

If you use Mod Configuration Menu, just make sure to download the MCM support module as well.

Otherwise you can always configure the mod from the config.ini file located in the Retinues.Core folder.

Retinues should be compatible with most other mods that introduce custom cultures and troops, including total overhaul mods.

Here for example I'm using Retinues with Realm of Thrones, and making a clan of Dothraki that adopted some Westerosi-style arms and armor.

That's it for now, I hope you enjoy the mod and have fun customizing your troops!
